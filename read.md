Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple web application that changes the background color of a webpage every second when the "Start" button is clicked and stops changing the color when the "Stop" button is clicked. The functionality is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Files Included
index.html: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
script.js: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for changing the background color.

How to Use
Open the Application:

Open the index.html file in your web browser.
You can do this by simply double-clicking the index.html file, or you can open it through your browser's "Open File" option.
Start Changing Colors:

Click the "Start" button on the webpage to begin changing the background color every second.
Stop Changing Colors:

Click the "Stop" button on the webpage to stop the background color from changing.
Code Explanation
The script.js file includes functions to start and stop changing the background color of the webpage:

randomColor(): Generates a random hex color code.
startChangingColor(): Starts changing the background color every second using setInterval.
stopChangingColor(): Stops the color change by clearing the interval with clearInterval.
This project demonstrates proficiency in JavaScript by manipulating the DOM and utilizing interval-based functions to create dynamic and interactive web content.
